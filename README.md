# Covid-Data-Analysis

	I performed data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, ensuring the dataset's integrity.
 
	I used SQL queries to explore the dataset, including basic queries like SELECT, FROM, and WHERE to filter and retrieve relevant data.
 
	I utilized GROUP BY and aggregate functions such as COUNT, SUM, AVG to summarize COVID-19 statistics by region, date, and other key dimensions.
 
	I implemented advanced SQL queries, including JOINs to combine data from multiple tables, subqueries to nest queries for complex analysis.
